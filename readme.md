# AI-Powered Email Automation Project

## Overview

This project automates the process of generating and sending emails to users based on data from a CSV file. It is designed to streamline communication and improve efficiency by leveraging artificial intelligence.

## Technical Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: Built using React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js to handle API requests and business logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and email logs.
- **AI Engine**: A Python-based service using Gemini 1.5 model for generating email content.
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer for sending emails via SMTP.

## AI Implementation

The AI component leverages OpenAI's GPT model to generate personalized email content. Key steps include:

1. Parsing user data from the uploaded CSV file.
2. Sending user-specific data to the GPT model API.
3. Receiving and formatting the AI-generated email content.
4. Integrating the content into customizable templates.

## User Workflow

1. **Upload CSV**: The user uploads a CSV file containing recipient details.
2. **Data Validation**: The system validates the CSV file for required fields (e.g., name, email).
3. **Email Generation**: The AI engine generates personalized email content for each recipient.
4. **Preview**: The user previews the emails and makes adjustments if necessary.
5. **Send Emails**: The system sends the emails in bulk and logs the status.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Ensuring data privacy and security.
  - **Solution**: Implemented encryption for sensitive data and secure API communication.
- **Challenge**: Handling large CSV files efficiently.
  - **Solution**: Used streaming techniques to process files in chunks.
- **Challenge**: Generating contextually accurate email content.
  - **Solution**: Fine-tuned the AI model with domain-specific prompts.
